## Content Bytes

Content Bytes is a community where content enthusiasts from different backgrounds share their knowledge and expertise, at the same time broadening their own.

Through regular meetups and events, we want to reach beyond the realm of technical writing to discover the related content fields.

We strongly believe that exploring areas such as UX and UI, product design, trainings and workshops, or project management can create a thriving content community ready to drive exciting ideas and initiatives.
